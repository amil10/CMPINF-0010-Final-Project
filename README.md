- Description: "This traffic-count data is provided by the City of Pittsburgh's Department of Mobility & Infrastructure (DOMI). Counters were deployed as part of traffic studies, including intersection studies, and studies covering where or whether to install speed humps. In some cases, data may have been collected by the Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission (SPC) or BikePGH."

https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/arrest-data/resource/e03a89dd-134a-4ee8-a2bd-62c40aeebc6f
- Description: "Arrest data contains information on people taken into custody by City of Pittsburgh police officers. More serious crimes such as felony offenses are more likely to result in an arrest. However, arrests can occur as a result of other offenses, such as parole violations or a failure to appear for trial. All data is reported at the block/intersection level, with the exception of sex crimes, which are reported at the police zone level."
